Applying classification algorithms to distinguish stars from galaxies using astronomical survey data.

## 📚 What We Learned from IBM Course 1

### Classification Fundamentals

Classification algorithms assign data points to predefined categories. The IBM coursework taught us that classification works by finding decision boundaries that separate different classes in feature space. Unlike regression which predicts continuous numbers, classification predicts discrete categories.

We learned core concepts including:

- **Binary Classification:** Distinguishing between two classes (like spam vs not-spam)
- **Logistic Regression:** Using probability curves to make classification decisions
- **Model Evaluation:** Using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrices
- **Feature Importance:** Understanding which variables drive classification decisions

The course examples used business datasets like customer churn or marketing response prediction. The algorithms learned to separate data into categories based on patterns in the features.

### Why Classification Matters

Classification is everywhere in business and science - medical diagnosis, fraud detection, quality control, recommendation systems. The ability to automatically categorize new data based on historical patterns saves time and enables decisions at scale.

## 🎯 How We Apply This to Astronomical Research

### The Scientific Challenge

Can we automatically classify celestial objects from their spectral measurements? This is a fundamental problem in modern astronomy where surveys like DESI collect millions of spectra, far more than humans could manually classify.

Using the DESI dataset (6.4M galaxy records), we're applying classification to distinguish:

- **Stars:** Nearby objects in our galaxy with characteristic spectral signatures
- **Galaxies:** Distant collections of billions of stars with different spectral patterns
- **Quasars:** Extremely distant, bright objects powered by supermassive black holes

The scientific value is enormous - automated classification enables large-scale studies of cosmic structure, galaxy evolution, and dark energy research that would be impossible with manual classification.

### Real-World Scientific Complexity

Unlike IBM's business examples, astronomical data presents unique challenges:

- **High-precision measurements:** Spectral flux values requiring careful handling of floating-point precision
- **Massive scale:** 6.4M objects requiring efficient processing algorithms
- **Scientific rigor:** Results must meet peer-review standards with proper statistical validation
- **Physical constraints:** Classifications must be consistent with astrophysical understanding

### Production Scientific Computing

The exercise demonstrates research-grade patterns:

- **Database validation:** Multi-stage data quality assurance on proj-pgsql01
- **Statistical rigor:** Proper train/test splits and cross-validation
- **Performance monitoring:** Processing efficiency for million-record datasets
- **Reproducible science:** Complete methodology documentation for peer review

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Scientific Data Processing

Unlike IBM's clean business datasets, we work with validated astronomical measurements:

```sql
-- Extract balanced sample of stars and galaxies
SELECT 
    targetid,
    z as redshift,
    flux_g, flux_r, flux_z,
    spectype as true_class
FROM fastspecfit_galaxies 
WHERE spectype IN ('STAR', 'GALAXY')
AND z BETWEEN 0.001 AND 3.0
AND flux_g > 0 AND flux_r > 0 AND flux_z > 0
ORDER BY RANDOM()
LIMIT 100000;
```

### Classification Model Application

Applying IBM's classification concepts to astronomical data:

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix

# Train models using IBM coursework techniques
logistic_model = LogisticRegression(random_state=42)
svm_model = SVC(kernel='rbf', random_state=42)

# Evaluate using scientific standards
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, precision_recall_fscore_support
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
precision, recall, f1, _ = precision_recall_fscore_support(y_test, predictions)
```

### Scientific Performance Requirements

Astronomical classification demands higher standards than business applications:

- **Accuracy:** >95% required for scientific publication
- **Statistical Significance:** Proper error analysis and confidence intervals
- **Physical Validation:** Results must align with astrophysical understanding
- **Reproducibility:** Complete documentation enabling independent verification

## 🔬 Scientific Context

### Astrophysical Background

Stars and galaxies have fundamentally different spectral signatures:

- **Stars:** Show absorption lines from elements in stellar atmospheres
- **Galaxies:** Show composite spectra from billions of stars plus gas emission
- **Redshift Effects:** Galaxy spectra are shifted to redder wavelengths by cosmic expansion

### Research Applications

Successful classification enables studies of:

- **Galaxy Evolution:** How galaxy properties change over cosmic time
- **Large-Scale Structure:** Mapping the cosmic web of matter
- **Dark Energy:** Using galaxy distances to understand cosmic acceleration
- **Stellar Populations:** Understanding star formation in different environments
