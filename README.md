This repository documents my companion work to the IBM AI Engineering Professional Certificate. I'm taking the concepts from each course module and applying them to research problems using datasets and infrastructure from my ongoing projects.

As someone who works as a systems engineer for an MSP and also does citizen science in astronomy, I have access to data from both commercial analytics and scientific research domains and thought this a unique opportunity to apply the methodologies to my own research.

---

## üìñ Repository Purpose

The IBM AI Engineering Certificate covers machine learning, deep learning, and generative AI through structured coursework. This companion work extends that learning by applying each concept to problems using production datasets and infrastructure I already have running.

I'm sharing this work to document my learning process and to show how course concepts can be applied to specialized domains. Others taking similar courses might find the methodology useful for developing their own advanced applications.

### Approach

Each exercise follows this pattern:

1. Complete the IBM module (coursework, quizzes/tests, and module projects)
2. Apply those concepts to problems using my research datasets
3. Document the methodology and results comprehensively

This transforms theoretical learning into practical application with production-scale complexity, with a peek inside engineering decisions, infrastructure performance and tuning, scripting and more.

---

## üéØ Cross-Domain Application

The exercises demonstrate how AI/ML concepts transfer across different problem domains:

**Gaming Industry Analytics:** Commercial data with business intelligence applications

- Market analysis, content classification, user behavior modeling
- Text processing, sentiment analysis, recommendation systems

**Astrophysics Research:** Scientific data requiring statistical rigor and computational efficiency

- Large-scale survey analysis, object classification, anomaly detection
- High-dimensional analysis, signal processing, hypothesis testing

**Infrastructure Integration:** Production-scale implementation patterns

- Database optimization, GPU resource management, container deployment
- Performance monitoring, scalability considerations, automation pipelines

Working across these different domains develops technical versatility and demonstrates how the same algorithms solve very different types of problems.
